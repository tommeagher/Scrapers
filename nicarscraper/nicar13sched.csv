Talk of an ""income gap"" ""or the 99%"" obscures a complicated reality and ignores most of the story - trends in the middle class. Income inequality is growing in many places, shrinking in others. Its pace and texture vary. Some causes are global and national, some are local. Come learn better ways to cover a complex story, including how journalists did recent stories and data tools you can use to analyze local trends."

Inside baseball: What data journalism can learn from sports;Ryan Pitts, Matthew Waite, Jeremy Bowers;Regency North;Saturday;10 a.m. - 10:50 a.m.;"This panel will identify areas for data journalism exploration by examining the current state-of-the-art baseball data analysis. Sports are the original form of data journalism -- box scores predate open government movements by about a century. And Joseph Adler's ""Baseball Hacks"" trained newbie Web CAR reporters how to scrape and analyze data sets using Perl and MySQL. Finally, sports analytics are a leading indicator for other kinds of analysis. Sensors, economic analysis, leverage are all de rigeur in baseball but still up-and-coming in data journalism. We'll take the concepts being used to analyze baseball, football, soccer and apply them to standard data journalism chores. A good example of this is leverage -- in baseball, an analyst attempts to find those situations in which a player had the greatest opportunity to change the outcome of a game. In data journalism, we might use a similar tool to analyze critical paths to an election win for a candidate or put together a network graph for bundled contributions to PACs."
